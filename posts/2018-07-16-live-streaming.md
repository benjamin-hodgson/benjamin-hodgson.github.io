title: Live-streaming
---

My esteemed colleague [Gervasio](https://twitter.com/g3rv4?lang=en) and I have arranged to live-stream some programming ~~this Friday, the 20th of July~~ **Update**: we've decided to move it to next **Tuesday, the 24th**, at the same time. We're going to be working on adding some basic `Span` support to [my parsing library](https://github.com/benjamin-hodgson/Pidgin), and it's going to involve `unsafe` and custom IL, which should be a bit of fun.

The stream will be [on YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O23OLkQtiS4) and we're planning to start at 2PM BST. Hope to see you there with your questions!
