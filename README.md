## How to submit a comment

1. Fork this repo.
2. Look in [the `comments` folder](https://github.com/benjamin-hodgson/benjamin-hodgson.github.io/tree/live/comments). You should see a subdirectory with the name of the post you want to comment on.
3. Copy and paste the `example.md` file in that directory. Change the filename to a number (the comment number) followed by the title of your comment. So, if you wanted to post the second comment in the thread, and the title of your comment was "Amazing post Benjamin!", your filename would be `2-amazing-post-benjamin.md`.
4. Write your comment and submit it to me in a pull request. I'll publish it as soon as I see it.
